# Design Documentation

This document provides an overview of the design phase of our robotic project, covering the system architecture, software and hardware design, and the different components used in the development.

## 1. System Architecture

The entire system is powered using a 2S LiPo battery regulated by a Step-Down Buck Converter. This was selected to meet the specifications of the Raspberry Pi 5, which requires a 5V and 5A input.

### Components and Data Flow
- **NXP FRDM KE-16Z Development Board**: Receives input from the IMU (Gyroscope and Accelerometer), Lidar, and the radio controller. The processed data from the radio controller is used to control the motor driver, managing the driving and steering of the robot.
- **Raspberry Pi 5**: Receives Lidar and IMU data from the NXP development board and acquires additional data from the wheel encoder. This data is processed using ROS and a SLAM framework.

## 2. Software Design

### Overview
The software design involves two main systems running on separate boards: the NXP FRDM KE-16Z and the Raspberry Pi 5, with data transmitted serially between them.

#### NXP FRDM KE-16Z Development Board
- **Operating System**: FreeRTOS is used for task scheduling.
- **Drivers and Applications**:
  - **UART, I2C, GPIO, ADC, FlexTimer**: Used for communication with sensors, remote controllers, and controlling the ESC and servo motor.
  - **Applications**: Motor control, data acquisition from sensors, and remote control command processing.

#### Raspberry Pi 5
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, chosen for compatibility with ROS2 Jazzy Jalisco.
- **Drivers and Applications**:
  - **GPIO**: Used for acquiring data from the wheel encoder.
  - **Applications**: Data acquisition, SLAM processing with GMapping, and data visualization in Rviz.

## 3. Hardware Design

### Robot Structure
The robot's components are organized across three levels:
1. **First Level**: Contains the motor ESC, servomotor, battery, and Power Distribution Board. The wheel encoder is attached to the robotâ€™s axis.
2. **Second Level**: Houses the Power Management system, including the Step-Down Buck Converter and Wago connectors for power distribution. The FlySky FS-i6 radio controller receiver is also placed here.
3. **Third Level**: Hosts the NXP FRDM KE-16Z development board, Raspberry Pi 5, IMU, and Lidar, all connected accordingly.
